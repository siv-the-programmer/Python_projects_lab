# Python Projects Lab

This repository is a personal Python practice laboratory.

It contains small, focused Python scripts created to reinforce core programming concepts through repetition, experimentation, and problem solving. Each project is intentionally limited in scope to encourage clarity, correctness, and understanding rather than complexity.

This repository exists to build real skill, not to showcase finished products.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this lab is to:

- Strengthen Python fundamentals through hands-on projects
- Develop disciplined problem-solving habits
- Learn how Python behaves in real execution, not theory
- Build confidence writing scripts without external assistance
- Prepare for automation, scripting, and cloud-related workflows

Every project is written with learning as the primary objective.
